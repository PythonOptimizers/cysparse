# CySparse

Python/Cython library to replace PySparse.

Due to a nice complete git crash disaster, I have deleted the develop and multi_types branches
the hard way... 

The master branch contains now the multi-types version only.

You **CANNOT** use the old version of CySparse except if you dig and clone commit ce86f8476166f63d0af72e38a477a761aecf4a7c .
