# CySparse

Python/Cython library to replace PySparse.

This is the multi-types version (last single type version: ce86f8476166f63d0af72e38a477a761aecf4a7c).

## Announcement

I'm in the process of replacing Cython properties by Python properties. This will take some time to settle down...
You might experience some (stupid) bugs or slower code.

## Want to follow the implementation of CySparse?

See Wiki for details!
