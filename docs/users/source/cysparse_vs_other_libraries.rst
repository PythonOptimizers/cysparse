:program:`CySparse` compared to other sparse matrix libraries
==================================================================

..	only:: html

	We compare briefly :program:`CySparse` with other existing libraries. If you are a user of one or several of these libraries, this page can also help you do the switch to :program:`CySparse` as we compare how things are done
	both in :program:`CySparse` and your preferred library.

:program:`NumPy`
================

:program:`NumPy` does **not** deal with sparse matrices, only dense ones but as it probably is **the** matrix library in :program:`Python` it is worth mentionning some similarities and discrepancies between the two.
