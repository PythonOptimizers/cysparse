:program:`PySparse` vs :program:`CySparse`
===========================================

Even if :program:`CySparse` is inspired from :program:`PySparse`, there are notable differences:

- :program:`CySparse` allow the use of matrices with different types of indices and elements at run time (see ...);
- :program:`CySparse` uses matrix views - a very light object - that represent parts of a matrix without the need to copy elements (see...);
