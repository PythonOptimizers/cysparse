:program:`CySparse`\'s types
====================================

Compatibility with :program:`NumPy`
=====================================

In short, :program:`CySparse`\'s types - although **different** - are 100% compatible with :program:`NumPy` corresponding types.

``nan`` and ``inf``
------------------------

``nan`` and ``inf`` are accepted and used internally as the `C99` standard recommends.
